# Reference-only cubic enrichment on G3

This experiment addresses lattice reference uncertainty. It does not add a
Meshers Tet20 product API, change the Microgen pipeline or establish a timing
advantage. All existing uniform and adaptive reference models remain retained.

## Analytic feasibility

Job 178 registers a degree-three tetrahedral Lagrange element through fedoo's
existing element interface. It checks all cubic monomials and their derivatives,
nodal interpolation, partition of unity and degree-four quadrature moments.
The cubic basis reproduces a nonaffine quadratic geometry mapping within
5.56e-16, and its derivatives within 1.34e-15.

A periodic solid patch contains 768 tets. The existing Tet10 control has
1,241 nodes and the enriched mesh 3,925. Both solve six prescribed strains.
Worst mixed-load stiffness errors against the analytic tensor are respectively
1.65e-12 and 4.75e-12. Independent positive 125-point reintegration agrees with
reactions and energy within 1.46e-11 absolute. Cubic periodic jumps are below
2.23e-16. This validates the experimental element and the shared helper's
unchanged default Tet10 route, not a lattice reference.

Records are in `runs/g3-cubic-reference-patch-v1`. Nine existing comparison
admission regression checks also pass after the helper extension. Unsupported
node counts no longer silently select Tet4 or Tet10 in these helpers; an
experimental element must be explicitly supplied.

## Measured lattice assembly stage

The admitted `g3-lattice-curved24-symmetric-v1` mesh has 9,907 corner nodes,
59,118 edges and 94,188 faces. Cubic enrichment therefore needs 222,331 nodes
on the same 44,976 tets, inside the existing 250,000-node stage.

Job 179 constructs this mesh, verifies periodicity and assembles its matrix
without solving. Peak RSS is 5.893 GiB under the unchanged 8 GiB ceiling.
The 666,993-square CSR matrix has 91,401,219 stored entries and occupies
1,099,482,604 bytes. This resource stage takes 54.81 seconds. It is not an
end-to-end meshing benchmark. Records are in
`runs/g3-lattice-cubic-assembly-memory-v1`.

## Pending reference solve

Job 180 uses that prepared mesh. Before solving, it verifies the source
quadratic mapping at every cubic node and embeds the saved parent fields.
Mapping disagreement is 1.67e-16; integrated parent stress and energy reproduce
the archived tensor within 2.17e-11 relative. Periodic checks pass.

The run has an 8 GiB ceiling and a hard 1,800-second worker timeout. After the
first load completes, it rejects continuation if solve-stage wall time exceeds
240 seconds. This is a completion gate, not an interruptible per-load timer.
Six completed solves still require independent own-rule stress and energy,
periodic jumps, Galerkin monotonicity and positive 125-point reintegration.
The retained quadrature sensitivity limit is 1e-4 relative. No new reference
or stiffness-accuracy claim is justified until these checks finish. Records
are in `runs/g3-lattice-cubic-reference-v1`.
