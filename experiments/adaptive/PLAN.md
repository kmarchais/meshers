# Adaptive implicit meshing: plan and status

Goal (Kevin, 2026-10-14): surface and volume meshes of implicit geometries that are
faster than VTK/MMG, with better element quality, fewer elements, and better
geometry fidelity (volume and two-sided boundary distance).

Constraint: a long GPU job owns the `gpu` queue. Until it is idle, run only small
single-threaded checks. Element counts, quality and geometry error are deterministic
and can be measured now; timing waits for the queue.

Branch `claude/adaptive-implicit` = `implicit-microgen-ready-20261003` (surface API,
compiled fields) + `fea-accuracy-optimizer` (PR #5 geometry guard, quality floor).

## Ideas, in order

1. Scorecard: independent two-sided distance (Newton projection, VTK exact
   point-to-mesh), volume error, triangle/tet quality, counts. No timing.
2. Size field from the implicit field: sag ~ k l^2 / 8, so l = sqrt(8 tol / k_max),
   k_max from the Hessian of the normalized field. Clamp and grade (hgrad).
3. Surface: coarse extraction, then adaptive isotropic remeshing on the implicit
   surface (split long / collapse short / flip to valence 6 / tangential relax +
   exact projection), with box caps and cap curves as features.
4. Volume: same size field drives tet adaptation (split, collapse, swaps, smoothing)
   with exact boundary projection; interior grades coarser.
5. Optional quadratic (tet10) output with mid-edge nodes projected on the surface.

## Status

- [x] Integration branch builds; 69 core tests pass.
- [ ] Scorecard and baselines (VTK Flying Edges, current meshers surface, meshers
      volume boundary).
